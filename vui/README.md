## Question

Can I embed an audio signature into a snip of audio so that a listener can align the track at given timestamps and distinguish a user's voice from generated audio?

## Answer

Many speaker systems and microphones use a high-pass filter at 17k hz, which is where I would need to place an inaudible audio signature containing timestamp information
